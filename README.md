# Data Stuctures And Algoritms

This is my repository for different dsa problems and their solutions (own approaches + the solutions that I code-read for better understanding and then attempting on my own -- sometimes I just dumped the source code for reference).

1. Arrays
2. Miscellaneous -- Linked List + DP + String
3. Stacks 
4. Queues
5. Trees
6. Graphs
7. Search + Sort

# Data Stuctures And Algoritms

this is my repository for different dsa problems and their solutions (own approaches + the solutions that I code-read for better understanding and then attempting on my own -- sometimes I just dumped the source code for reference).

miscellaneous file has linked list + DP + strings problems, rest all file names are self explanatory.

1. Arrays
2. Linked List
3. Stacks And Queues
4. Trees
5. DP
